##Intro

Blinky building and map making continue -- with yet another take-away treat! First we'll build a map to spot a national phenomenon. Bring a laptop if you'd like to try your hand as we go. Next, we'll build a new blinky with a super-simple sensor. First-timers always welcome!

##For Your Cupboard
