##Intro

Blinky building and map making continue -- with yet another take-away treat! First we'll build a map to spot a national phenomenon. Bring a laptop if you'd like to try your hand as we go. Next, we'll build a new blinky with a super-simple sensor. First-timers always welcome!

##For Your Cupboard

Digital kitchenware that's great to have on hand for cooking up data projects. New items added each class, as they are used. The growing list is [here](link). 

###Ingredients
Physical items you can buy to build your own blinkies. (Always fun, never mandatory.)

- [Candle-flicker LEDs](http://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/partsmenu/408)
- [Coin-cell Battery Holder](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8822)
- [Tilt Sensors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10289)
- [Copper Foil Tape](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1128)

###Utensils
Simple services you should sign up for to make thing easier to cook online Often free. 

- A [Google](http://accounts.google.com) account, if you don't already have one
- A blog if you don't have one. So you can embed and show your work.
	- [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com) is a good one. 
	- I use [Posthaven](http://posthaven.com).
- [Github](http://github.com) to store and share your code
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) A free place to host your web pages
- A domain name. Preferably your own name! I use [myhosting.com](http://myhosting.com)
	- Don't get the full hosting; just a "parked" domain for now

###Appliances
Software to help you process your data and projects. Usually downloaded, often free.
