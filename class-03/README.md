##Intro

Blinky building and map making continue -- with yet another take-away treat! First we'll get our computers to count dots inside shapes on a map (which is super useful). Bring a laptop if you'd like to try your hand as we go. Next, we'll build a new blinky with a super-simple sensor. First-timers always welcome!

##For Your Cupboard

Digital kitchenware that's great to have on hand for cooking up data projects. New items added each class, as they are used. The growing list is [here](link). 

###Ingredients
Physical items you can buy to build your own blinkies. (Always fun, never mandatory.)
